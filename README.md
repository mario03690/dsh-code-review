# dsh-code-review

Pre-commit polish for coding agents: strict code review, test-case generation, README/changelog/commit-message drafting — the highest-frequency thing a coding harness does.

## What & why

A thin bundle over the same review endpoint tuned for the coding loop: paste code or a diff and get a concrete review (bugs, edge cases, security, perf — each with a fix), generate test cases, explain unfamiliar code, and draft the README/changelog/commit message before you ship. Deterministic where it can be, model-backed where it must be; first heavy call free, then billed at real cost.

Start with `what_can_you_do` — describe your task in any language, get the exact tool and a ready-to-run call.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <your-profile> add github:mario03690/dsh-code-review
```

Thin config layer only (one `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` row, shipped as `cordis.patch.yml`) — no tool code on your machine. Built against the dsh v0.1 developer preview's MCP client config shape (2026-08-13); if a later preview changes it, open an issue for a same-day fix.

## Cost, quota, privacy

First heavy call is free (anonymous, no signup); afterwards billed at real upstream cost, reported in every response; failed calls are not charged. Bring an [AllRouter](https://allrouter.ai) key to run any tool on a flagship model at direct rates. The config URL carries `?s=dsh-dsh-code-review` — a channel tag identifying the install path, not you.

**Disclosure:** built and run by the team behind [ainetcafe.com](https://ainetcafe.com). Full bundle: [dsh-netcafe](https://github.com/mario03690/dsh-netcafe). MIT.

## Compatibility & permissions (at a glance)

| Signal | This plugin |
| --- | --- |
| **Runtime** | dsh v0.1 developer preview (2026-08-13, Cordis v4). Touches only the MCP client config shape — the narrowest surface available. Verified against a live endpoint on 2026-08-17. |
| **What runs locally** | Nothing. Ships one `cordis.patch.yml` row; there is no tool code, no build step and no lifecycle script in this package. |
| **Filesystem access** | None. |
| **Shell / process access** | None. |
| **Network access** | Outbound HTTPS to `ainetcafe.com` only, from the MCP client that dsh already ships. |
| **Credentials** | None required. No signup, no API key for the free tier. An optional AllRouter key, if you supply one, is sent by dsh as a request header and is never stored by us. |
| **Data retention** | Documents and prompts are processed in memory and not retained. |
| **Dependencies** | One peer dependency: `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` (ships with dsh). |
| **License** | MIT (see `LICENSE`). |
| **Publisher** | The team that runs [ainetcafe.com](https://ainetcafe.com) — our own hosted service, free tier plus paid usage. Issues get a same-day reply. |
